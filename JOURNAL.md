## 10/5/2025 1:10 AM - Started the FPGA schematic + power source + flash memory!  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUzLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--10325b518c1b619ca2fa1d52d23c7a5788f552d9/image.png)

Added decoupling capacitors for VCCIO, VCC and a filtering system for VCCAUX.
Tied all relevant VSS/VSSQ pins to ground, as per standard practice.
Decided on components for the power source, and chose to use the AMS1117 (Fixed), for the main power supply, and then various TLV713xxPDBV modules for smaller voltage rails (DDR RAM + FPGA).
Chose the W25Q128JVS, as this was a flash that was supported by the ECP5.   

## 10/5/2025 1:14 AM - Finished flash memory + JTAG

Added net labels and connected the pins of the flash memory (did not do WP or RESET as they don't have specific FPGA pins). 
Initializing the JTAG was easy, as they just needed a couple of pullups/pulldowns!
I also decided on the RAM module that I wanted to use, which was the MT41J128M16JT-125_KTR. This is a 2GB DDR3 memory, for only ~$3, which is actually pretty affordable!  

## 10/5/2025 1:18 AM - Finished RAM schematic + thoughts about potential routing.

Building off of the RAM module that I chose, I took a look at the reference manual/datasheet, and mapped the pins to the particular FPGA pin that was needed!
I also added a bunch of decoupling caps since I needed a really stable and clean power source to the RAM. 
Address and Data pins did not have a specific pin to map to, so I assigned it in a logical way that would make it the most easiest to route. 
I also made sure to make a mental note to do impedance (50 ohms) and length matching.  

## 10/5/2025 1:24 AM - Routed the DDR3 RAM (DID NOT DO POWER YET)

Keeping in mind the strict impedance (50 ohms) and length matching (clock + data + address traces), I started and finished the routing today. (This should be the most up to date thing for now). 
I put some 33 ohm resistors to improve ringing resistance, and provide a termination point for the clock signals. Address did not need resistors, even though they are "recommended" as the trace lengths were under 1 inch! 
I had to spam skew tuning because most traces had to be length matches and my eyes just see squiggly lines....
But yeah this was worth the effort and tomorrow I have to suffer doing power (backside of the board...)  

## 10/5/2025 2 PM - Finished DDR3 Routing + USB Serial Schema

So I think I violated some common conventions of routing but here I am!!!
Sadly I had to do via on pad for the DDR3 ram power, since they are decouplings and I can't place them too far...
After that nightmare was over, I started on the USB + USB serial converter schematic since it was a pretty important portion to me! I took a look at the datasheet, and pin mapped relevantly!
I also did the microSD schematic since it was decently easy, and I was really familiar with it!
I'll probably start routing a bit later during the day!  

## 10/5/2025 5 PM - Routed USB + Flash Memory  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTk0LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ae7d02e1f334c30aed53d1d9b75538ffda953d4d/image.png)

I finished routing all of the USB and flash memory components!!!
I didn't attach a picture, but I mapped all of the relevant usb/flash pins to FPGA GPIOs. I tried my best to fanout the BGA in a way that saved most of the GPIO pins. 
Remembering to keep 90 differential pair impedance for the USB traces, and thick traces for the power traces!
I still need to do power, which might take alot of time :pensive:!
