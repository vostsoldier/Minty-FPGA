## 10/5/2025 - Started the FPGA schematic + power source + flash memory!

Added decoupling capacitors for VCCIO, VCC and a filtering system for VCCAUX.
Tied all relevant VSS/VSSQ pins to ground, as per standard practice.
Decided on components for the power source, and chose to use the AMS1117 (Fixed), for the main power supply, and then various TLV713xxPDBV modules for smaller voltage rails (DDR RAM + FPGA).
Chose the W25Q128JVS, as this was a flash that was supported by the ECP5.
