# Minty - A ECP5 based devboard with DDR3 RAM
## An introduction
Hey fellas it's Technical here with a cool beans board!!!
I wanted to experiment with FPGAs and RAM at the same time, so I thought, why not just combine the two onto one board!
What a great idea right!!! Hahahahahahhahaha!
But yeah thats how this board came to be...
At the time of writing (10/5/25), the board only has a few key parts needed for it to function..
HOWEVER, I am planning to put more cool stuff onto it, as I have like 150 IO pins left lol...
Feel free to DM technical_. on the Hack Club slack if you have any ideas for what to put!!!
